#the four main deployment strategies in kubernetes deployments are:
#1. Rolling update
#2. Recreate
#3. Blue/Green
#4. Canary

Labels: labels are key-value pairs that are attached to k8s objects, such as pods
and services. They can be used to select and route traffic to different versions of a service.

labels are intended to be used to specify identifying attributes of k8s objects.
They are not intended for general use in the deployment process.

labels can be attached to objects

kubectl get pods --show-labels

#defining pods with specific value:
kubectl get pods -l key=value

#add label to a resource
kubectl label pods [pod-name] key=value

#override existing labels
kubectl label pods [pod-name] key=value --overwrite

#remove pod label
kubectl label pods [pod-name] key - 

#command to identify rollout status
kubectl rollout status deployment redis-deployment

#list the history of the rollout of a deployment
kubectl rollout history deployment redis-deployment

#rollback deployment 
kubectl rollout undo deployment redis-deployment --to-revision=1
